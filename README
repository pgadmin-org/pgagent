pgAgent
=======

This document describes the compilation of pgAgent, a job scheduler for
PostgreSQL.

pgAgent is managed using pgAdmin (http://www.pgadmin.org). The pgAdmin
documentation contains details of the setup and use of pgAgent with your
PostgreSQL system. The latest build of the documentation can be found at
https://www.pgadmin.org/docs/pgadmin4/development/pgagent.html.

Building pgAgent
----------------

You will need:

- A C/C++ compiler, such as GCC or Microsoft Visual C++ on Windows.
- CMake 3.3 (from www.cmake.org)
- A Boost library 1.41 or higher installation
- A PostgreSQL 8.3 or higher installation

1) Unpack the pgAgent source code
2) Create a build directory in which the code will be built.
3) Run ccmake from the build directory (on Windows, use the CMake graphical
   interface). By default, ccmake will generate Unix Makefiles - consult the
   documentation if you wish to generate other types of output:

$ ccmake /path/to/pgagent

4) If required, press 'c' to generate a default configuration:

CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE                 Release
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX             /usr/local
CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES          x86_64
CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT                /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.10.sdk
PostgreSQL_CONFIG_EXECUTABLE     /usr/local/pgsql/bin/pg_config
Boost_FIND_REQUIRED              ON
Boost_FIND_QUIETLY               OFF
Boost_DEBUG                      OFF
Boost_USE_MULTITHREADED          ON
Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS            OFF

5) Use the ccmake interface to adjust any settings as required. When configured
   as required, press 'c' to re-configure (if required) and 'g' to generate the
   build files and exit.

6) Run 'make' to build pgAgent on Mac or Unix, or open the generated project
   files in VC++ on Windows and build the solution in the desired configuration.

Running Regression Tests
========================

To run the regression tests, use a command such as:

make USE_PGXS=1 -f test/Makefile installcheck

You will need to ensure that the appropriate pg_config executable is in the path
and that variables such as PGPORT and PGUSER are set if required.
